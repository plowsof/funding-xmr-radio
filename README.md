# funding-xmr-radio

forked from https://github.com/plowsof/xmr-wishlist-aaS/

This version auto generates QRcodes for each of your wishes (with a custom logo). 
You can now supply a USD goal amount with a % buffer and the XMR will be calculated.
If the markets fluctuate, all of the goals can be reset in relation to the current USD value of XMR (with a buffer also.. - or +) 
CryptoGrampy pushed me in the direction of supplying more data in the json files to help the web UI and also incorporate it into rss fees (interesting direction)

I will be updating the original wishlist github with this new one shortly. 

My wishlist would be that if you're reading this, then continue supporting the Monero community in whatever capacity you can and do not forget to make friends along the way.

The other item would be a 2nd monitor or something! :), it is so difficult to do these kinds of things with the tiny one i have :<
