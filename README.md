# funding-xmr-radio

forked from https://github.com/plowsof/xmr-wishlist-aaS/

- This version auto generates QRcodes for each of your wishes (with a custom logo). 
- You can now supply a USD goal amount with a % buffer and the XMR will be calculated.
- If the markets fluctuate, all of the goals can be reset in relation to the current USD value of XMR (with a buffer also.. - or +) 
- CryptoGrampy pushed me in the direction of supplying more data in the json files to help the web UI and also incorporate it into rss fees (interesting direction)
- I was on the verge of tears trying to get the QRcodes to display correctly but thankfully m2049r from Monerujo saved me and offered help / solutions. Thank you!
- The Monero GUI UI actually inspired me to display the sub addresses the same way... Doh.. was staring at the solution the whole time (as they're so long)
- Ajs_ - huge thank you from me. He gave me full creative control of his funding page and trusted me with full server access to configure some things. And allowed me to help with some other xmr.radio related things

I will be updating the original wishlist github with this new one shortly. 

## XMR Radio wishlist fully funded - service discontinued (for now)
